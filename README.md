Step 1: Set Up Development Environment

    Install Development Tools:
        Install Node.js (for package management and running scripts).
        Install Bun (for bundling, as mentioned in the project stack).
        Install React and TypeScript for creating the extension's UI and functionality.
        Set up a basic project structure using tools like Create React App or Vite (if using React and TypeScript).
    Install Browser Extension Development Tools:
        Chrome Developer Tools and Firefox Developer Tools for testing.
        Set up a browser extension scaffold (e.g., create a manifest.json file for Chrome and Firefox).

Step 2: Define the Extension's Manifest File

Create a manifest.json file that adheres to Manifest Version 3 (MV3). This file will define important metadata like:

    Permissions (e.g., tabs, storage, etc.)
    Browser compatibility (Chrome and Firefox)
    Background scripts, content scripts, and popup components.

Example of manifest.json for Chrome/Firefox (MV3):

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Delete Facebook Messages",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["*://www.facebook.com/messages/*"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": "icon.png"
  }
}

Step 3: Sidebar and Popup Integration
Step 4: Build the Language Adaptability Feature
Step 5: Develop the Core Functionality for Deleting and Archiving
Step 6: Create Error Handling and Status Feedback

Step 7: Test the Extension Locally

    Chrome Testing:
        Load your extension in Chrome via chrome://extensions by enabling Developer Mode and selecting "Load unpacked."
        Test for any issues in functionality, language support, and performance.
    Firefox Testing:
        Load your extension via about:debugging and select "This Firefox."
        Test across various Facebook account languages and ensure it works as expected.

Step 8: Optimize the Performance
Step 9: Publish and Submit to Chrome Web Store & Firefox Add-ons


npm init -y

Install React and TypeScript using the following commands:

npm install react react-dom
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom

Install Bun (Optional but recommended for faster builds):

    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash


Step 7: Test the Extension

    Load in Chrome:
        Go to chrome://extensions/.
        Enable Developer mode.
        Click Load unpacked and select your project folder.
    Test in Firefox:
        Go to about:debugging.
        Click This Firefox.
        Click Load Temporary Add-on and select your manifest.json.
